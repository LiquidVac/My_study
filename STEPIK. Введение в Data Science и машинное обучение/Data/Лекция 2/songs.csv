Got you quiddear and ski-dared, fearin what we might do
And you can give me all mine in cash, that will suffice dude

Looks like it's time to eat, so yo who's with me?
Strictly, we keep it in the best perspective
Cause nowadays it's more than simply live and let live
A sedative, that's what these headcases need
Them rats'll get trapped soon as they taste the cheese
Black M. Casey fan, just pay us and scram
Watch us drop a new supply to up the daily demand
Phony critics want to retract shit, once I spit again

Like a cannon
'Cause i been plannin' to be rammin' what i wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as i suggest we take a good look
At who's who while i'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as i slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
'Cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but i still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so i break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr

Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions i made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there i got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind i find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So i can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'

We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours

Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can`t be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you`ll catch hell you`ll get dealt with

I always peep
Rhymes creep
I`m 2 Deep
I`m 2 Deep....
I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

And I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part
So we Bleed in the name of god
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven
There won't be release
I cannot, I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
I cannot, I will not
Deny it's false innocence
I cannot, I will not

Come take my hand
Searching for the talisman you'll find it
On another plane far from all time

The same faces
Everywhere
You can't find yourself in it
Cause you're a part
I'm another

Don't want to see us come up, don't want to see us makin' G's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves no discussion
Peace to my man Hass, and Orange Man payin the cost
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers gettin' tossed
into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich Nigerian
Powerful American that's proud to be an African
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin' trapped
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you goin' nowhere
And you can swagger like you rule this; Josey Wales
unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK 2 LAX
They're always makin' trouble yo, against the righteous
Killin' us in cold blood, those beats those vipers
And as I sit feelin' the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
to their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress

Peace brother elijah
Hey peace guru, how you doin?
I'm maintainin
Just been thinkin though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Somethin I read in the holy qu'ran how it says
""has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's islam, christianity
Juddaism, buddha-ism, old school-ism or new school-ism
If we're not schooling the youth with wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
That's keepin it -- wrong
Chorus: guru
Now that we're gettin somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leary
It's our inheritance; this is my robbin hood theory... robbin hood theory
Verse one: guru
I seek sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The god's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the code of the streets
Meet your defeat; this is my robbin hood theory... my robbin hood theory
Verse two: guru
I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush resedential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fuckin up my black community
And we ain't doin no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfuckin donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they gettin greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best to wait son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my robbin hood theory

Verse three: guru
God is universal, he is the ruler universal
For those who can't follow that spells guru when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity

But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
and like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
but don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
on Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
and check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit

To take my kindness, for weakness, cause they don`t seem to
Respect my generosity, and what it`s costin me
Is headaches, I don`t like fakes, or people bossin me around
You clown, it`s time I beat you down
You tried to play me betray me and slay me, and now you`ll drown
In the river, I`ll give ya, reasons you should shiver
Cause when I get to wreckin and deckin, I won`t forgive ya
You had the opportunity, for bein cool with me
You stabbed me in the back you duck, and now you`re soon to be
Disarmed, embalmed, I`ll break off all your arms
And then your legs, you`ll beg, I`ll crack you like a egg
And spill your yolk, you joke, I`ll duff you in the eye
And you`ll say, ""Why?"" And bleeding and pleading, you`ll start to cry
And I`ll reply with a confident sigh, ""There`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""
No More Mr. Nice Guy

Yo ?, this is somethin that I want to tell to you, sell to you
And as I speak you girlies yell to your friends, ""Yo it`s him!
He`s shockin again!"" This is the season for breezin with reason
Because I`m in, charge of the attack on suckers who just rap on
Wack track that lack that snap, while I just mack on
Honies who look good and, they all want the wood in
They push up, to get up close, to serve me puddin
And I just tell em, ""Look here, I am not a crook there""
But I like to snatch em all, cause like a hook they`re stuck
Struck, they tried to press their luck
They want to tease me and skeeze me and please me, to squeeze the bucks
From my pocket that is bulging, I`m not indulging
In lame games with phony dames, too busy buildin my fortress
Score this, drink while I pour this
I`m livin and givin my rhymes, so I`ll ignore this
Garbage you are runnin, I am not the one and
You`ll never get to vamp me tramp cause I`ll be stunning your mind
I`ll sign, my name on your behind and cool you off
Like frost, I`m leary of the way you double cross
Get lost, I`ll tell you you are fly and say goodbye
And burning and yearing you`ll ask my why
And I`ll reply with a wink of an eye, ""There`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""
No More Mr. Nice Guy
No More Mr. Nice Guy
Oh sure, you`re, running back for me
I`ma great you defeat you and beat you, show you the door
Cause you ain`t really welcome, you know you`re seldom
Thinkin of your fellow man, but you still til them
You want to be a friend then, you keep pretendin
You`re two-faced, so you`ll taste, just what I`m sendin
POW, now, you`re shaken sayin WOW
You stare, you fear, my wrath is too severe
I never let up so get up I`m fed up, and I don`t care
I`ll duff you in the eye and you`ll say, ""Why?""

born-in-a-mourning-hall,2006,blind-guardian,Metal,"In fact it was close to a real fallout
Everything's under control
The speaker said with a serious smile
Behind his mask
He knew the truth
I'll bring a new age of better ways
The TV preacher said
Just pay today
Pay today
World's dressed in black
On earth's judgement day
And I?
I know it can't go on
Forbidden signs increase
I'm sitting still at home
And watching
Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields
Get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger
Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing things
'Cause I am
Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheared on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
That Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
And I'm a part of the machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel, once
Now I'm an old man
Oh, I know this can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue, my nerves, my mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye
Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
Is suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side",1542,4,0,0,0

You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks

It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin"" but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
Hi spops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle,fam and all that
He could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks, he wore when
he took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?

Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out,6-8,12th grader
Fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
while he's starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family
That's betrayal
Betrayal

They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy
Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em then your mama says
""son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played gee
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy",2278,5,0,3,1

It stayed, cause people love when they played

To the big cities, with lots of hustle and bustle
To Chicago, and to the Apple too
This was a scene, that our forefathers knew
Go get your crew, I know they`ll get into
The jazz music... jazz music
The music called jazz had the razzamatazz
It had the flavor, and a lot of pizazz
The big band beat was very neat and unique
The swing was king, it made you tap your feet
There was Benny and Duke and of course the Count Basie
The melody was smooth and yes, very taste
There was Hap, The Prez, and Lady Day and
Dizzy Bird and Miles, they were all playin'
They brought it to the people of the foreign lands
Back across the oceans and the desert sands
Where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
And it rises with the sun on days begun

On a tidal wave, only the good I'll save

And sit back there, contemplate, calculate
And concentrate on these rhymes, that I picked to stick

Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle,fam and all that

He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
while he's starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail

Plannin to examine you, on a petrie dish
Sticking you and frickin you, just a teenie bit
I`m clever, with science, but never relyin
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin
Insistin they come off, I let `em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks, their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin, like makin love, i`ll never stop thrustin
Into your system, so just listen
I`m like a neurosurgeon, operatin wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The thought gets prescribed, as I kick it live
Cause it`s more that a style, it`s conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak
Check the technique
I`m rushin you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, and then`ll be breakin you
Taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
Makin you succumb to the drums of gangstarr
By far we are, truly gifted ones son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin
You`ll be dyin, tryin to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you`re statin
So i`m chumpin, puntin punks just like footballs
Cause I want to put y`all, back in the messhall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap`s crazy wack, so don`t try to pull that
You`re lackin the vernacular, i`m slappin ya and cappin ya
And closin your jaw, cause you can`t mess with gangstarr
The guru and premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off hobbes, check the technique
""Bon voyage"", ""sayanora"", ""arriva derci""
Your ass gets busted doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me - because you copy and falsify
And I don`t care how many step up, cause you all can try
To wish and fish for a style, here`s a fishin rod
These rhymes are hittin hard, constantly i`m gettin large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don`t sleep, but just peep me
Puttin methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 rpm`s displays the art of men
And as my rhymin builds you see my time it`s chill
And then I look upon weak ones
I`m teachin each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like french braids
Or tied up like corn braids, cause I got a strong way
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
Cause this ain`t a slave sale and I ain`t the same stale
Rapper, no, i`m not a phony microphonist wit no blaster
No type of real appeal or real - talent
And it makes me violent man
To see all of these peewee bee mc wannabees
Makin g`s for some dumb companies
And lots of money but no idea what is rap and what is dope
So check out what the guru wrote
Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough braincells so I can stay paid well

Mc's I lay out like stiffs in the morgue
Praise the lord you're in awe when I'm grippin the mic cord
Rhymes I rip with swift execution
One verse to coerce your girl to prostitution

Beware when I'm making hits with premier and

Night crusaders able to break down barriers
And bringing faces of death putting mc's to rest
Until there's no fake chumps left

Mad brothers in every city you can feel the tension
To stop the killing wack mc's must die
Who am ? I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
When I unleash my speech I'll have you punk rappers open
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phoney get the fuck from in front of me

Lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores

I'm high strung but don't mistake me when I smile
I murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
After the killing just like casper I'm ghost
Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun you'd be done
Throw up your hands bitch and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully have you calling your big brother
Although I'm five foot eight they call me sargeant

Ohhh yeah
One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of feindish when I'm at this
Been doin this for eons, peons best to catch this
vision of excellence, precise rappin ability
Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin funny yo
As soon as some niggaz get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin played out
When authentic niggaz step up, respect be layed out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, waving my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, creme de la creme
Spent years buildin with cats in the streets, so they my men
Again, GangStarr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listening to beats to keep the cypher complete
Wether you kids be holdin, on the block all day
Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library
Wherever you are Baby Pah, realize that your essence
is divine son, and let it shine son
As we refine son, aiyyo, this shit'll blow your mind son
We're royalty
Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest
And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey annoits me with oils G
After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
Whatever I do, Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

moment-of-truth,2006,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth baby
They say it's lonely at the top, in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth
The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although mc's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize, what I have done up to this point
So I'mma get more guys, to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks, will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is coming to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth
Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen, to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin, is mad amazin
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin
Suicide? nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinking, or even gettin high
Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
So I oughta be able, to withstand some more
But I'm sweating though, my eyes are turning red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime, was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect, that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""
Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully loaded lines
You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine, I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggas, and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin at the situation plainly: will you remain g?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator, with the greater data
Revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
A lot of emcees, act stupid to me
And we have yet to see, if they can match our longevity
But anyway it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout, blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business, were truly not done right
Throw up your he-allah-i now, divine saviors
You got no hand skills there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop, to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",4322,58,1,1,6

No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old Alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while

Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

No questions why

Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create

And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A
Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right

That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work

Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools

Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority

I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna` snatch kids jewels
After that 50 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn`t even get all the equipment out
And we didn`t even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it`s really fucked up
So I`ll ask you to your face homeboy what`s up
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigga playoffs
Killing you and killing me it`s the soliloquy of chaos
And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You`ll find it doesn`t pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you`ll want to retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it`s another brother dead
But I know you`ll never get that through your head
'Cause we`re mislead and misfed facts, we`re way off
Killing you and killing me, it`s the soliloquy of chaos",2443,18,0,0,0

Reach level 99

Dream forever
Sunlight instead of neon light
How will it be
Welcome to my grave
And feel the dream is over

Built up on lies

Of walls and lots of lies

There's more above than ice
To reach the top

A sensless worth
In useless brains
Magic runes
Without a meaning

Fills empty rooms

Changing my mind and dreams

So much cream chumps they can`t understand it

Curious, to test the weight you be holdin

Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position

Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound

Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished
It seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity
My boys they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine
This honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy
She mad like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned
But please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her
She said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things
And she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down
Cuz I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on?
You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick
Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning cuz I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out
So she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry
So listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack

Niggaz I hurt still holler about how wrong I am
As a little nigger broke, thinking soda and coke
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept in the flow
Let it sit, cool and heart lit, hit the set cool and heartless
In front of the store projects, as long as I made a profit

Filled with pages of episodes and shying me
Nonbeliever I hammer for hire
Hit yo ass so hard that your coke will catch fire
Dog the stakes are dyer, I'm no liar
Hold the court and the street beef cause I got pride
Same team no games, these chicks I blow brains
Rap-a-lot soul train the corners rocking cocaine
Got no shame
Trying to blow these figures

just-to-get-a-rep,2008,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Want to do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep
Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, ""we'll hurt you""
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, ""yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep",1726,16,0,0,3

You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact

I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today

If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb

Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`

the-illest-brother,2008,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!
Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect
[Chorus:] repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",4220,12,2,2,0

The emotions that one goes thourgh, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones

Some get caught up, others are innocent victims

To bring back light and hope for all

Fooled by the hands of doom

Caught in the afterlife

Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet

But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now

Till she has said
Goodbye
Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release

Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her
So I heard all about it

She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears

Little tune I just composed not so long ago
Ms. Billie Holiday
Byrd?
The music called Jazz
It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow
Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil
Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues
St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth in all the listener's ears
Fulfillin' the needs and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing
King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew
Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence of a jazz thing
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music, jazz music
In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete
Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even [Incomprehensible], and this is real history
Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was [Incomprehensible]
A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place
And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring the metaphysics of a jazz thing
John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue and of the promise
That was not kept, he was a giant step
And there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the Bangles couldn't use it
Now listen see, the real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated
And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
Of course we know who can really blow
Scheamin' on the meaning of a jazz thing
And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it
She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems

Is born that night
The misty pond
(Has) got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do
With our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and
It's cruel
Will grace die in pain?
Will light ever rise again?
I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice
(I'm) wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself
To rise
In the silence
It's time to explain
(And)
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned

When it all begins
Oh at dawn

Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
But
Don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Play the song of death

I can't flee
Inner pain caused insanity
It's deep within

Of some shocking volts, he doesn`t know what he`s talkin about
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I`ll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he`s a waste of
My time and your time so I`ll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you`re looking for rap that`s exceptional
And credible, straight to the G`s you better go
Cause GangStarr`s known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
But still be a cold day in Hell when you hear that
Guru or Premier ever tell suckers get sales
But they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
That was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
I`m the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
And I`ll say, that they`ve still got a long way to go
To show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe

Cause most MC`s ain`t really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

All this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I`ll shine so bright I`ll be blinding your eyesight

On a basketball court still you try to rap
And even claim you got new styles but
Rolling your tongue`s been playe dout for a while
And you don`t sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you`re wack so you ruined that
I couldn`t make out what you were saying your diction
Is jumbled where as me I`m conveying clear thoughts
To a crowd that`s most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn`t name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn`t pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
But that`s OK cause I`m peeping your card
If rap was my house you`d be sweeping the yard
As I recline I`ll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don`t even trip or run off with the lip

Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face to feet to defeat, you can tell I`m into it
As I`m pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner`s throne, cause I own you once you step in the arena

Forget it, cause you`d rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I`m strong, I`m like Hercules
You`ll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena
In the arena or forum, weak MC`s I will floor `em
Causin' mayhem, I`ll slay them, and the blood`ll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none`ll be

Every night I hear thunder.
The shadow, can't you see?
So one night I will follow.
The dark side reigns in me.
(He) leads me to the dark plains.
The end is near, I feel.
But (I've) never seen his damned face.
My hearts pound hard in fear.
Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
A hundred solemn faces,
they look at me and laugh.
But if one wants to touch them,
they glow through nothingness.
If I come to tell you,
you look at me and laugh.
I never found the doctor,
so one day I'll be mad.
In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.

And only by action will any ideas solidify

In the universe by a mad magican
To conquer the power of his magic
A place where truth waits must

In the streets we roll alone so watch me running up

Night crusaders able to break down barriers

when I unleash my speech I'll have you punk rappers open
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phoney get the fuck from in front of me

traitors they'll be robbing your stash man
don't wanna end up like the last man
if the price is right niggaz can get trife awright
they plot and they scheme all day and all night
and they might even get elaborate enough
to plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff
like this chick who was kickin it, with this baller
pretendin that she loved him, only really loved dollars
holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
said to his man, ""forget him, i'm fond of you""
so after the screw, she put him down with her plan
the utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
but the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
while in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough
she said, ""yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
and i know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
i'll leave it open for you, he won't never know
so run in, grab the money, later on, you and i can flow
if we do this shit right, he won't fight
break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight""
so the nigga sat back, but little did he know
he was about to ruin his life over a silly hoe
and really though, the whole shit went wrong
cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit
dukes with the mask, told him, ""run your shit""
he said, ""fuck that shit!"" so they tussled n shit
then blaow, the burner spit, and the chick's man got hit
he died, his man had no loyalty, she's locked up as an accessory
his man's doin life, what a tragedy

I wouldn't let you go

much-too-much,1992,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed cuz you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Check the G-U-R-U yes the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true cuz you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
Cuz I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape cuz I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
Cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

take-a-rest,2006,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MC's have luck but suck
So I pluck em like feathers on the back of a chicken
Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sick 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock em all out and
They think they know things, like what I'm about and
They try to analyze criticize scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize, that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast, you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed, with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin my money, and investin it wisely
Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin I'll be bombin the dumb
Deaf and blind cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin MC's with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime til morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a three-eight, blowin your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
Cause you're simply a pest in this mess I suggest you
Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin they're alla that, their voices are all flat
They're findin their names, in a Wack Rapper's Almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound, to somethin Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MC's like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter
Playin a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hitcha
Square in your face I'll crack your ribs and your chest
Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double ""take a rest""
Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
Cause they know better, than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust you can trust cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on, while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay, or slap em up quick
Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""",3602,43,0,0,6

And a sense of guilt I can't deny

The places I had planned for us to go

They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t

I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps

And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I`m out

Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""

All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure
And parting is grief
And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
See the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me

no-shame-in-my-game,2008,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain

They watch like Movado so I floss like I'm lotto
You ain't lounging, til you've been counting by the thousands
Profiling, pushing more weight than your medallion
We be wilding, locking blocks down just like the Island
Dough piling, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Balling, cop some Charles Jordan and some icebergs
Ice herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me, you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watching me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout

And I cop the meanest shit, still ride DISCUS
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
For now I'm rolling right, cause I had four faces
Fighting four cases in ?North face? of Dolomite
So if he's here I ace the toners out my holding tight
Shorty looking innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nothing innocent here, this henneson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party yea is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snugly fitted, ruggedly hitting
Fitted in my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it

To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm bagging up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whispering mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent is ?seemiyaka?
All the way from Green Acre's to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw newriqi L and then a sweet for my girl
Styling, on the cell phone smilin, it's my world
Can't forget the Avorex, pocket for the royalty checks

Still faking that you`re hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I`ll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You`re gonna need a mob against me cause I`m lethal
Not that I`m a violent brother to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC`s in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn`t be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn`t have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get an MC
That starts out street to crossover
But not me, cause I`m the hardcore composer
You ain`t a writer nor a fighter you`re just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite
Of the reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you`re really a crab
So I`ll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don`t waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick cause I can kick plenty styles
Rhymes stretch many miles

Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here`s some advice you can`t rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why? Because I`m bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
As brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers want to rhyme cause they`re eager to find
The secret behind the way that I stomp all comp

In a world which is turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while

Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine

To walk down to the wasteland

I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy
Welcome to the new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins
The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all
What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all

And now I'll tell You
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends

Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day

You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said

Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy

Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks

Than it is for a person to run one's own life

Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo

Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb

In relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine

Accomplishments, are achieved on floppy disc
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it

While other groups have faded, just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
To expose every vain
Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Cain and Abel, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power
Not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor til
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'mma wet them
In other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name
GangStarr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower

Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open

But to be chosen is indeed our gift
You better get a job quick
See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak

peace-of-mine,2007,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"Aiyyo, what the fuck is this shit that y'all are listenin to
Nowadays on the radio man? you call that shit hip-hop?
That's some faggot bitch shit y'all are listenin to!
All you dj's are lettin the program directors handcuff you
And sit there and tell you how to mix?! you fuckin robots!
Fuck y'all!
Real talk, serious thoughts
True and livin with a youthful vengeance, yo
(Trust me, I'm as live as it gets)
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?
With the truth nigga, stop misleadin the youth nigga
Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga
Our hood's in danger, kids need guidance
You keep lyin, still the young keep dyin
As I walk through the valley I fear none, yes I'm the chairman
Here with my nigga premier son
And we came to change the game
We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin flows and chasin hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin yo
Producers makin tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
Their ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on
Our shit be rugged, like the new york streets
Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin else
You're better off back on the ave doin somethin else
All you suckers claimin that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin you prankster
I thank y'all for makin more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in

You ain't livin right punk, I'll have to school you
Not rule you, but I'll say yo you fool yourself
When you try to deny and defy written laws
This means your cause has lost
Think about it, take the time, and even ponder longer
Then let your mind start to wander
Go black and track the facts, about all of your mistakes
It only takes to one to make fate
Pick up your life, clean up your act, and get a legal plan
You can, or be an evil man
Caught, and then you claim you're not responsible
The choice was yours, when the fun's gone you will realize
That you don't get somethin for nothin, why you bluffin?
Others even brothers are stuffin their pockets
With honest cash, they'll laugh, so don't knock it
Jock it, cause the guru must stop it
I'll jab you, smack you, crack -- you're demolished
You must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
Get a degree in reality
Or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
Gone, never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
* primo scratches *
[guru]
Exactly what you put in boy, you will get out of it
The energy released comes back, there is no doubt of it
So when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
This means you'll bleed from greed
Dig the rhyme dig the thought, of what'll happen
You're nappin, you're gonna fall off the map 'n'
Lie out, and cry out, why? you got the short end of the stick
Cause you're too quick to run tricks
Open your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut
Move, and get the lead out of your butt
Cause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump
And you shouldn't stand to let
Anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
Chill, cause you know the chosen youth will
Take over, and control the whole so don't blow it
Know it, cause the guru must show it
I'll teach you, reachin each so you're enlightened
Emcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs
Cause I express what I manifest
While some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
* primo scratches *
[guru]
You're still playin games lame, I'll have to end you
Straight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom
Will you decay as you pay in repentance
I light my sentence like incense
Breathe in, expel your fears as you marvel
Heed what I feed, you won't starve you'll make it
But if you don't, you will be finished
You'll dissapear, you will diminish
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin down yourself, bringin down the pace
Bringin down your friends, bringin down the race
Will leave you bugged and upset
Cause homeboy life is cause and effect

I've to face the truth
But not today

They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya

You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive

You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite

To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover

He carries along
From a distant place
He's on his way
He'll bring decay
(Don't move along
'Cause things they will go wrong
The end is getting closer day by day)
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for starlight we wait for the moon
The sky is empty
Alone in the unknown
We're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed
By the wind and rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made
Should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed
But now he's gone
Go out and get it
The madman's head it
Shall be thyne
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in disguise
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided by the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra
You may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Sister mine
Death's a certain thing
Find myself in darkest places
Find myself drifting away
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed
I'm falling down
As time runs faster
Moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you
My dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and poems lost
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end Iliad
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the way
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of there
You've chosen misery
Power and wisdom
You deny
Bad choice
War is the only answer
When love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made to the fairest
The graceful says badly he fails
Warning
Fear the heat of passion, father king
Don't let him in
Don't let her in
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
We can't get out
Once they are in
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
Jealousy

I can clearly see the end now

Nowhere to hide

And as the lion
Slaughters man
I am the wolf
And you're the lamb

Round the walls
Faith is shattered bodies fall
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose

Roam in darkness
Spread the vision
We will be lost if you truly believe
Troy in darkness
There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
That they've gone away
And won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie, lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome
The old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite
The end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now
There's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing
And dance with us now

Have you forgotten him
Far from the land
Where the sun is born
down in the wood ""Caladon""
Do you know the place
where the light is never seen
and all the hopes are turned
by the final cry
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Turned to Stone
Whispering tunes in the wind
all hopes are gone with the night
when the old man will never come back
remember his words and his songs
And we see the raven's flying in the distance
but no wizard's singing his song

I fly in time
The last candle will burn
there's hope for everyone
when the last candle burns high
oh it's time for life
The elves and gnomes have to hide
when the moon is showing it's face
and raging orcs will set their traps
and the forest will burn

and love the dark
they don't understand
that they're caught and left alone
they feel the magic in the wind

Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
Kickin' Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion; the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief, plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what, you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin'
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin'
Demandin' that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday
I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal, spreadin' my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, Dick, and Jerry, slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal, like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay Noyd-ed
'Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black, talkin' 'bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes bein' made
No wack shit bein' played, no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho, spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap, through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals, like Moses
Travellin' high sands and Eastern lands, for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin' through the streets, like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger
A thirty-eight escalate the murder rate, for us niggaz
It's like, microphone roulette, 'cause nowadays MC's is gettin' wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep",3845,88,0,0,8

A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.

On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure
And parting is brief
And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
Midnight Special
Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
Wee the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me
If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me (on me, on me)
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special

the-illest-brother,1992,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!
Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect
[Chorus:] repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",4220,12,2,2,0

You find yourself saying ""who me"", time and again

Ahun, so think about it while you`re messing up clown

Here is the reason you should listen and learn
`Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
`Cause after all the highs, you`re gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
`Cause if you don`t have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit

Premier is here with the flair, we're running to you
Bust your grill with skill, as we build and fulfill
I drop the wisom to quiz them, with precision we drill
We're kicking wannabes down cause we're gonna be down
We're moving on with the sound, see we're gonna be around
For a long time, I kick the strong rhymes
You're empty-handed and stranded cause you were standing in the wrong line
This is not the fate is for sure a pure pen
The gift is hitting home on your dome because we meant it
You'll need a graffiti, don't heed and you'll be bleeding
We'll rip you, and ship you back and you'll be repeating
The progress, and I guess that you should be told now
Lo and behold how the stroll I unfold now
Knowledge, wisdom, and peace are what I'm true to
In the rear is premier, and I'm the guru

I chill in new york city, I'm witty, so get me
To brooklyn, so I can ill and peace no joke
You slow poke, you'll go broke, you're rhymes ain't all that dope
So take a backseat, with all your wack beats
This is the one phase of my rage and onstage I slap eats
For you to try to steal this, I will reveal this
Like a prophet, I'll drop it, premier will start to seal
This coffin to be chewing, you soft and you'll be doing
A dance with some ants in the ground, you clowns be chewing
But you could never get this, the talents we've been blest with
So many different ways to phrase, you shouldn't mess with the guru

So here's the verdict, cause all you suckers know you're booty
You're played out, you'll fade out, I doubt that you can do me
We ain't having no gabbing, when I be grabbing and jabbing
In your ear like a spear prepare your body for battling
Cause you've been preparing to move, you'll be certain to lose
Open your eyes up, wise up while I work with the groove
To teach your next school, who'll be the next fool?
That I can stomp down with compound nouns but like a pestule
Come back with dumb raps, then like a tech inside

It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust

Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock em all out and

Realize, that I'm not to be played with

All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds

Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me

And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin the fakes like a taste of some poison

Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter

Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much

And I won't stop til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some

They get bust you can trust cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on

Up my spine and going strong

ex-girl-to-the-next-girl,1992,gangstarr,Hip-Hop,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker,
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin` me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I`d better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can`t swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I`m driving
Surviving in the 90`s is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she`s busted let`s discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I`m still gettin` crazy calls, my ex-girl`s got balls
Don`t want to play the field 'cause I get lovin` at home base
Don`t gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c`est la vie, much respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl 'cause I`m on with the next girl
[Chorus]
She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she`s crying wolf and I like don`t want to hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she`d tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c`est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl 'cause I`m straight with the next girl
[Chorus]
You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how`s my sister then asked how`s my brother
Didn`t ask about my father 'cause you know he ain`t like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he`d really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can`t believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I want to live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin`
Yes darlin` was fly and this was the problem
'cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin`
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I`ve seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin` me hon
went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c`est la vie, much respect girl
But now you`re my ex-girl & I`m out with the next girl
Out...

The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he`s a waste of
My time and your time so I`ll kick the pure rhymes

Peace Brother Elijah
Hey peace Guru, how you doin?
I'm maintainin
Just been thinkin though man
about the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Somethin I read in the holy Qu'ran how it says
""Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
whether it's Islam, Christianity
Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
that's keepin it -- WRONG
Chorus: Guru
Now that we're gettin somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers

It's our inheritance; this is my Robbin Hood Theory... Robbin Hood Theory

I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
while politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
and tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robbin Hood Theory... my Robbin Hood Theory
Verse Two: Guru
I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
from the wild ghetto districts to the plush resedential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fuckin up my black community
And we ain't doin no more interviews
til we get paid out the frame, like motherfuckin Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they gettin greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best to wait son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here

Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin

I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out
Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that? Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it
Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me

My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her

Everyone's on the tape, the hood's filled with dirty blocks

It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust
Think about it, that requel shit some fucking junk

Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to find a cause, I won`t pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I`m like claws
That`ll rip `cause your gift, is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you, would give it a rest
But if you don`t, I`ll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
A true hero, while you`re a through zero
Gettin beat to a pulp so that you can`t run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I`ll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face to feet to defeat, you can tell I`m into it
As I`m pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner`s throne, cause I own you once you step in the arena
In the arenak, or rather coliseum
There`s people gatherin by multitudes to see one
Perpetrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born wit the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up, makes GangStarr want to snatch up

Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it, to the battle set

But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, cause you`d rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I`m strong, I`m like Hercules
You`ll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena
In the arena or forum, weak MC`s I will floor `em
Causin' mayhem, I`ll slay them, and the blood`ll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none`ll be
Tryin' to toy wit a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants cause you can`t figure any
Foe that can step to this concept so
You better sit again citizen, weak MC`s I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, cause they didn`t listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who`s itchin
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena",2832,45,0,0,5

And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there i got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind i find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So i can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'

Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song that's beyond comprehension",1820,20,0,0,0

[Music and lyrics by Greenway / Cook.]
Hallelujah [3x]
[Guitar lead]
I am a preacher with a message for my people
Over the world, scratching on the ground
Looking for the peace that nobody has found
I am a spokesman for a better way of living
Love is the word and it can be heard
If you are young the message can be sung
[Guitar lead]
Let me hear you sing
Hallelujah [3x]
Oh tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all
Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd
Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified
There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find
If you live and let the people in your world
Speak its mind
I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom
All over the world and it can be heard
If you are young the message can be sung

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot

When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools

So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A
Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right

That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way

""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" ""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk, America's best""
Yo, it doesn't make sense, for you to compete against
This New York vibe that gets your whole body tense
Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle
Then I'll drain all your fluid, you're better off playing lotto
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday
""From New York straight talk, America's best""
""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" ""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk, America's best""
True if you can make it out here, you can make it anywhere
That means a lot of rappers, they should stay away from here
Cause we still care, about the total artform
Niggaz could sell more records but they still can't flip a live forum
Plus everybody out here ain't talkin true shit either
Mad niggaz is fakin jacks, I don't like them neither
But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, P-Lawn
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday
You get bent up, sent up creek, without a paddle
You want to battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They want to shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But GangStarr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why suppress it, I'd rather be revealin it

Now give the credit... where it is due

I'm heated up, cause I'm seein' folks that are so phony
They didn't know me when I was broke and I was lonely
Only a few came to check me, so they come first...
... And yo our people come next G
We'd go to a club, the Milky Way or the Payday
The outlaw spots, where the music was real hot
And you wasn't there, when the underrated, real MC's
Came equipped... and used to kick slick lyrics
All live, without no lip sync
To a dope crate, building skills from instinct
I'm tired of people, gettin' all excited
I'm not trippin' on just a thing, but I'm delighted
To let you know, that some others be flim-flammin'
I'll let you know, that all this time, we been jammin'

If the next man deserves it, earns it, it should be law

While they be sweatin' and pretendin' that they know a real rap sound
But I know some guys, and some ladies, that can fill those spots mate
To promote the real greats
And educate, and get it straight
And mobilizin' the imitators, exposin' the explosive core
I hope to explore
Galaxies of remedies for your wack rap sickness
As I convey relay, mack rap quickness
In this business, I witness trickiness
Some MC's are into stickiness

I didn't get this far overnight, and there's nothin' like
The real thing, the real swing right? (real swing right?)

So won't you give the credit y'all where it is due

So yo I'm fed, cause people like to talk too much
They're misled, and yo they like to squawk too much
But let me tell you baby you can't front on this
Twenty-for track mix, with the deep-ass kick
The objective, is to surely demolish
The chances of the wack takin' all the dollars
Support the brothers who are truly gifted
This way, the odds, could never be shifted
Like my man, you know he works real hard
He's good at what he does and now he lives real large
So why envy him, or anyone in his crew

Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes

Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
